  <h1>How the virus spreads</h1>
  <img src="images/spread.jpg" width="40%">
  <div style="font-size: x-large;">
<p>COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, linked to a live animal market.<br> 
  This virus is now able to infect humans and can spread from person to person:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)</li>
  <li>Via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and are inhaled into the lungs of a person
     nearby.</li>
  <li>Possibly through touching an infected person who has touched their own mouth and nose which are spread when a 
    person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.</li>
</ul>
