<h1>Who are most at risk?</h1>

<p>People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<br>
   Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to 
   be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.<br>

  WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good 
  hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.<br>

  COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available<br>
   information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher <br>
   risk for severe illness from COVID-19.<br>

  Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>People 65 years and older</li>
  <li>People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility</li>
  <li>People with diabetes</li>
</ul>
