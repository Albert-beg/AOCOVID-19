  <h1>What is Corona virus</h1>
  <img src="images/cov.jpg" width="50%">
  <p style="font-size: x-large;">Corona viruses are a large group of viruses many
     of which cause no or minor illnesses, like the common cold. Some cause illness in people, and 
     others only infect animals. Usually these infections do not cross over from animals to people.<br> 

    On rare occasions, coronaviruses that infect animals “change” and develop the ability to
     infect people. This has occurred with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute<br>
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) where the causative viruses were probably initially infections of bats. 
      The new (novel) corona virus was probably also an infection of bats but is now able to infect people. 
      The new (novel) corona virus is officially called 
      Coronavirus Disease-2019 or COVID-19 (because it was first detected in 2019).</p>
