<h1>Vaccine or Cure</h1>
<img src="images/vac.jpg" width="50%">
<p style="font-size: x-large;">There is no official vaccine or cure for the virus. <br>When a disease is new, there is no vaccine until one is developed.
   It can take a number of years for a new vaccine to be developed.<br>
   A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, 
   there are multiple attempts in progress to develop such a vaccine. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect
    a vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months.
     Previous attempts to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS, established considerable knowledge about the structure
      and function of coronaviruses – which accelerated rapid development during early 2020 of varied technology platforms for a COVID-19 vaccine – 
      but all the previous coronavirus vaccine candidates failed in early-stage clinical trials, with none being advanced to licensing. </p>
